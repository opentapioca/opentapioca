OpenTapioca is a simple and fast [Named Entity Linking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking) for [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). It is kept synchronous with Wikidata in real time, encouraging users to improve the results of their entity linking
tasks by contributing back to Wikidata.

A live instance is running at https://opentapioca.org/.

See [the docs](https://opentapioca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information about how it works and how to run it. See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09131) for more some motivation about the design of the system.
