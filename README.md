[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/opentapioca/badge/?version=latest)](https://opentapioca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Build Status](https://github.com/wetneb/opentapioca/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wetneb/opentapioca/actions) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/wetneb/opentapioca/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/wetneb/opentapioca)

OpenTapioca is a simple and fast [Named Entity Linking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking) for [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). It is kept synchronous with Wikidata in real time, encouraging users to improve the results of their entity linking
tasks by contributing back to Wikidata.

A live instance is running at https://opentapioca.org/.

A [NIF endpoint](https://github.com/dice-group/gerbil/wiki/How-to-create-a-NIF-based-web-service) is available at https://opentapioca.org/api/nif.

See [the docs](https://opentapioca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information about how it works and how to run it. See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09131) for some more motivation about the design of the system.

OpenTapioca is released under the Apache-2.0 license.
